# Customer-Service-Chatbot
The customer service chatbot aims to assist and support customers to meet their needs and ensure their satisfaction with an artificial intelligence program designed to simulate conversation with human users.
# Requirements for the Conversation.
Salutation and Initial Interaction: The chatbot should commence by cordially greeting the user. The system should inquire about how it might aid the user.
Comprehending User Queries: The chatbot should possess the capability to comprehend and provide appropriate responses to a diverse array of user queries. The user did not provide any text. The system should employ natural language processing (NLP) to decipher the user's intention.
Information Provision: The chatbot should furnish precise and pertinent information in response to user inquiries. It should have the capability to extract information from a repository of knowledge or frequently asked questions (FAQs).
Managing Transactions: The chatbot should provide step-by-step guidance to the user for transactions such as booking, ordering, or making payments. Implement robust security protocols to safeguard the handling of confidential data.
Escalation to Human Agents: If the chatbot is unable to resolve a problem, it should smoothly transition the conversation to a human agent.
